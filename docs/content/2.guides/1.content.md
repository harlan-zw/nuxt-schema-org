## Introduction

Nuxt Schema.org integrates with Nuxt Content out of the box, supporting a `schemaOrg` frontmatter key that can be used to configure your pages
schema.org data.

You can see a demo of this integration in the [Nuxt OG Image & Nuxt Content Playground](https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-hgunsf?file=package.json).

## Setup

No extra set up is required, simply add the `schemaOrg` key to your frontmatter.

It's recommended to provide an array of Schema.org nodes, otherwise you will be extending the [`WebPage`{lang="ts"}](https://unhead.unjs.io/schema-org/schema/webpage) node with the provided data.

```md [Array]

schemaOrg:
  # Define new nodes
  - "@type": "BlogPosting"
    headline: "How to Use Our Product"
    author:
      type: "Person"
      name: "Jane Smith"
    datePublished: "2023-10-01"

```

```md [Object]

schemaOrg:
  # Augment WebPage to an AboutPage
  "@type": "AboutPage"
