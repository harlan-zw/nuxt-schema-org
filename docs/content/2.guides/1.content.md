## Introduction

Nuxt Schema.org integrates with Nuxt Content out of the box, supporting a `schemaOrg` frontmatter key that can be used to configure your pages
schema.org data.

You can see a demo of this integration in the [Nuxt OG Image & Nuxt Content Playground](https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-hgunsf?file=package.json).

## Setup Nuxt Content v3

In Nuxt Content v3 we need to use the `asSchemaOrgCollection()`{lang="ts"} function to augment any collections
to be able to use the `schemaOrg` frontmatter key.

```ts [content.config.ts]
import { defineCollection, defineContentConfig } from '@nuxt/content'
import { asSchemaOrgCollection } from 'nuxt-schema-org/content'

export default defineContentConfig({
  collections: {
    content: defineCollection(
      asSchemaOrgCollection({
        type: 'page',
        source: '**/*.md',
      }),
    ),
  },
})
```


To ensure the tags actually gets rendered you need to ensure you're using the `useHead()`{lang="ts"} composable with the `head` key.

```vue [[...slug].vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
import { queryCollection, useRoute } from '#imports'

const route = useRoute()
const { data: page } = await useAsyncData(`page-${route.path}`, () => {
  return queryCollection('content').path(route.path).first()
})
// Ensure the schema.org is rendered
useHead(page.value.head || {})
useSeoMeta(page.value.seo || {})
</script>
```

## Setup Nuxt Content v2

No extra set up is required, simply add the `schemaOrg` key to your frontmatter.

## Usage

It's recommended to provide an array of Schema.org nodes, otherwise you will be extending the [`WebPage`{lang="ts"}](https://unhead.unjs.io/schema-org/schema/webpage) node with the provided data.

::code-group

```md [Array]
---
schemaOrg:
  # Define new nodes
  - "@type": "BlogPosting"
    headline: "How to Use Our Product"
    author:
      type: "Person"
      name: "Jane Smith"
    datePublished: "2023-10-01"
---
```

```md [Object]
---
schemaOrg:
  # Augment WebPage to an AboutPage
  "@type": "AboutPage"
---
```
