Nuxt Schema.org automatically generates JSON-LD structured data for your pages, enabling [rich snippets](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/search-gallery) in Google search results like star ratings, FAQ accordions, and recipe cards.

Rich snippets can increase click-through rates by up to 30% and provide users with more information before they visit your site.
