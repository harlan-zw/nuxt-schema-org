## Setup Module

:ModuleInstall{name="schema-org" included-in="@nuxtjs/seo"}

::warning{title="SSR Required"}
This module requires SSR for automatic schema generation. For SPA/CSR apps, manually add schema:
```ts
useHead({
  script: [{
    type: 'application/ld+json',
    innerHTML: JSON.stringify(yourSchema)
  }]
})
```
::

## Verifying Installation

After you've set up the module, you should be able to visit your home page and inspect the Schema.org. You'll find the
`<script type="application/ld+json">`{lang="html"} tag with the default Schema.org nodes near the `</body>`{lang="html"} tag.

This is generated by the [defaults Schema.org](/docs/schema-org/guides/default-schema-org) and you can modify the output
if it's not what you need.

You can debug this further in Nuxt DevTools under the Schema.org tab.

## Next Steps

It's recommended to use this module with Nuxt Robots so that the non-indexable paths are automatically excluded from adding
Schema.org.
