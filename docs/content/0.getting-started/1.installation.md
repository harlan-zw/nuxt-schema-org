## Module Setup

:ModuleInstall{name="schema-org"}

### SPA Warning

Due to the code required to generate Schema.org nodes, it is recommended to use SSR when using this module.

If you need Schema.org support in an SPA please use `useHead({ script: [{ type: 'application/ld+json', innerHTML: '...' }] })`{lang="html"} to add Schema.org nodes.

## Previewing Your Schema.org

After you've set up the module, you should be able to visit your home page and inspect the Schema.org. You'll find the
`<script type="application/ld+json">`{lang="html"} tag with the default Schema.org nodes near the `</body>`{lang="html"} tag.

This is generated by the [defaults Schema.org](/docs/schema-org/guides/default-schema-org) and you can modify the output
if it's not what you need.

You can debug this further in Nuxt DevTools under the Schema.org tab.

## Next steps

It's recommended to use this module with Nuxt Robots so that the non-indexable paths are automatically excluded from adding
Schema.org.
