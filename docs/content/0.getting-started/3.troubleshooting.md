## Debugging

### Nuxt DevTools

The best tool for debugging is the Nuxt DevTools integration with Nuxt Schema.org.

This will give you your Schema.org graph and handy links to test it.

This is enabled by default in development, simply navigate to the Schema.org tab.

### Debug Config

You can enable the [debug](/docs/schema-org/api/config#debug) option which will give you more granular output. This is enabled by default in development mode.

This will allow you to access `/__schema-org__/debug.json` which contains the raw config used to generate the Schema.org nodes.

### External Debugging Tools

You can test your Schema.org using the following tools:
- [Google Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
- [Schema.org Validator](https://validator.schema.org/)

## Debugging Tools

- [Schema.org Validator](/tools/schema-validator) - Validate JSON-LD and Microdata markup, find errors, and ensure proper implementation for rich snippets

## Submitting an Issue

When submitting an issue, it's important to provide as much information as possible.

The easiest way to do this is to create a minimal reproduction using the Stackblitz playgrounds:
